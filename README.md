Hi everyone! Welcome to my github page. I'm currently working on my Masters in Data Analytics, and will graduate in the Summer of 2027. I'm using this repository to post my bigger SAS projects, as well as Python and SQL projects that I'm learning on the side. I'd like to become a Data Scientist once I graduate, and hopefully this portfolio will help me get there!
