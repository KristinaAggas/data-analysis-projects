## 🔍 **About This Portfolio**

Welcome! This site showcases my analytics, statistics, and machine learning projects created during my Data Analytics M.S. program and independent research.

My work focuses on:

- Predictive modeling & regression  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Statistical analysis (ANOVA, hypothesis testing, diagnostics)  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Comparing methods across Python, SQL, and SAS  
- Communicating complex findings clearly  

You can also find all source code on my GitHub:

## ⭐ **Featured Project**

### **Bike Share Demand – Regression Modeling (2025-11-14)**

A full regression analysis exploring how seasonality, weather patterns, and environmental factors influence daily bike rentals.

**Highlights:**
- Built multiple linear regression models  
- Included transformed predictors (e.g., log temperature, humidity)  
- Examined multicollinearity, VIF, and diagnostics  
- Compared Python and SAS implementations  
- Produced an interpretable final model explaining rental behavior
